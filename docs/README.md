# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Process documentation. This guide serves as your entry point to understanding how we run projects, define roles, and deliver value at OctoAcme.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management process is designed around clear roles, defined workflows, and a commitment to continuous improvement. The project lifecycle follows a structured progression: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase has specific deliverables and checklists to ensure alignment and accountability, such as the Project One-pager during initiation, a prioritized and estimated backlog in planning, and a detailed release and deployment checklist before going live. This structure helps teams validate business needs up front, break work into achievable increments, and maintain momentum through regular demos, status updates, and retrospectives.

Key project roles are well-defined to support collaboration and accountability. The Project Manager (PM) coordinates delivery, tracks schedules, manages risks, and ensures transparent communication across stakeholders. The Product Manager (PdM) is responsible for defining outcomes, prioritizing the backlog, and measuring success against customer and business value. Developers focus on building, testing, and delivering features that meet acceptance criteria, while QA/Testing provides validation and ensures quality standards are upheld. Stakeholders are engaged throughout, providing input and approvals at key stages.

Communication practices are central to OctoAcme's approach. Regular touchpoints include daily standups, weekly PM and PdM syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and milestone-based demos or reviews. Status is kept transparent through project boards, risk registers, and concise written updatesâ€”using templates to standardize weekly status and incident communications. Escalation paths are clearly mapped to resolve blockers rapidly, moving from the team level to PM, Product Lead, and Sponsor as needed.

Quality assurance and risk management are deeply embedded in the workflow. Automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), CI pipelines, and security scans are required before merging code. Checklists ensure that criteria such as test coverage, risk register updates, and backup plans are not overlooked. Retrospectives after each sprint or release drive continuous improvement by capturing lessons learned and converting them into actionable items, which are then tracked to completion and measured for impact. This disciplined approach enables OctoAcme to deliver reliable outcomes while fostering a culture of learning and transparency.
